# SupplyChain_Analysis
Supply chain analytics using Power BI enables businesses to make data-driven decisions for optimizing their operations. By analyzing data such as time forecasting, sales by region, category, and month, along with monthly profit figures, companies can gain a comprehensive understanding of demand patterns. The Power Query Editor is instrumental in this process, allowing users to clean and preprocess the data by removing inconsistencies, filtering out noise, and aggregating relevant metrics.

Once the data is polished, Power BIâ€™s dashboard capabilities come into play, facilitating the creation of interactive visualizations. These dashboards can display trends in sales across different regions and categories, forecast future demand, and highlight profit fluctuations over time. By integrating these insights, businesses can effectively align their supply chain strategies with market demand, ensuring they remain responsive and competitive.
